# Android-Course-Earthquake
This is a project work that was done from 5/2021 to 8/2021 in a group of four students. Here an Android program was developed using Java, as well as an algorithm for determining the location of an earthquake using Python. 

The code from Python was then imported into Java.

The project contains two folders with two Android programs. The first folder is responsible for determining the location of the earthquake epicenter, and the second folder is responsible for creating test simulated earthquake waves.

Also in the Detektor/app/src/main/python folder there are all the Python files for locating the earthquake epicenter.

Java programs could be found in a similar folder, but with the name "java".
